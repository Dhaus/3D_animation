For this assignment, we searched through a database of obj meshes and each selected one that we wanted to use. The three we decided on were images of a deer, a bear, and a car. Once the objects were selected, each of us wrote a class with heirarchical grouping for our corresponding objects. Daniel Hauser animated a deer that moves across the screen, pooping repeatedly (sub animation). Aparna animated a bear that moves up towards the sky as if it's being abducted. Around the bear, there are small particles that have also been lifted by a beam that is portrayed as lines that utilize the lerp() function. The parcel animation is tied with the bear for it’s sub animation.

Aparna - One of the biggest challenges for me was learning how to work with different camera set ups. There was a bit of a learning curve, but I was able to learn it and utilize the camera function properly. Then, we also had the problem of modifying the position of one object, which inadvertently altered the position of other objects. Danial H found a solution to this problem by calling pushMatrix() and popMatrix().

Daniel Hauser - Aparna and I pair programmed the bear and deer objects. She drove when coding the bear while I drove while coding the deer. I also added the flat ground and the ufo.

Daniel Choi - The things I learned most was the difference variation that I needed to sort and distinguish by pushing and posing the matrix to make sure the objects don’t over stack. I programmed the automobile and the sub animations of the exhausts that are coming out the back end of the automobile.
